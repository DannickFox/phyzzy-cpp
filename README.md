# phyzzy-cpp
A simple 2D spring-mass system library. Inspired by Sodaconstructor.

Simulates a given two dimensional spring-mass system with an Euler integrator. This is still a work in progress and was initially made to help come up with a better way to organize the object construction for phyzzy-js but has become a bit of a project of its own. This still does not have a way to show the system graphically but it is being considered.
